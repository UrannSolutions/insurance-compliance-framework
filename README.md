# Sales Performance Operating System
## Executive Overview

Designed and implemented a structured sales performance operating system for a fully remote, high-volume inbound organization. The objective was to align revenue outcomes with measurable behaviors, reduce execution drift, and protect lead economics through real-time correction frameworks.

This system integrates KPI architecture with behavioral retraining protocols to create predictable performance without micromanagement.

## 1. KPI Architecture & Revenue Controls

Established a structured dialer KPI model governing quoting behavior, application progression, close rate performance, and efficiency utilization.

## Core Control Metrics

- Quote Rate (Target: 70%+ on engaged calls)
- Application Rate (Target: 40%+ of quoted calls)
- Close Rate (Target: 10–15%)
- Talk Time per Hour (Target: 35–45+ minutes)
- Average Call Duration (Target: ~7 minutes)

These metrics functioned as operational control levers rather than passive scorekeeping.

## Architectural Intent

- Detect breakdowns early in the call lifecycle
- Isolate where conversion friction occurs
- Protect cost-per-acquisition in inbound environments
- Tie behavior directly to revenue output
- Standardize coaching language across managers

## 2. Daily Growth & Behavioral Correction Framework

Developed a structured self-diagnostic system enabling agents to identify and correct performance breakdowns in real time.

The framework introduced defined intervention triggers:

- 7+ short calls → opener / rapport issue
- Engaged calls without quoting → transition failure
- Multiple quotes without applications → value or trust breakdown

Each trigger required:

1. Immediate pause from live selling
2. Structured recording review
3. Guided self-assessment
4. Targeted rehearsal and tone correction
5. Re-entry only after correction

## System Design Principles

- Accountability without supervision dependency
- Correction speed as the primary mastery metric
- One-call-close discipline in inbound environments
- Emotional connection prioritized over script rigidity
- Lead protection as an economic responsibility

## Cross-Functional Impact

This operating system required coordination across:
- Sales Leadership
- QA & Call Review
- Training & Enablement
- Revenue Operations
- Incentive & Compensation Design

The result was a repeatable structure enabling distributed operators to self-regulate performance while maintaining alignment with organizational revenue goals.

## Capabilities Demonstrated

- Revenue Performance Architecture
- Behavioral KPI Design
- Sales Conversion Mechanics
- Distributed Team Governance
- Coaching Systemization
- Lead Economics Protection

## 3. Structured Conversation & Conversion Framework

Designed a standardized inbound sales script engineered to guide prospects from introduction to application while maintaining compliance, emotional trust, and one-call-close discipline.

The framework emphasized:
- Immediate rapport establishment
- Guided fact-finding before quoting
- Emotional positioning prior to price presentation
- Objection isolation and recovery sequencing
- Controlled transition into application and payment steps

This structure reduced call drift, increased quoting consistency, and improved close predictability in a high-autonomy remote environment.
