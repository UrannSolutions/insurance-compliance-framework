# Sales Performance Operating System

Built a structured sales performance operating system for a fully remote, high-volume inbound org. The goal was to connect revenue outcomes directly to measurable behaviors — and build in real-time correction so the whole thing runs without micromanagement.

## 1. KPI Architecture & Revenue Controls

Designed the KPI model from scratch — not as a scoreboard, but as a set of control levers that tell you exactly where in the call lifecycle something is breaking down.

## Core Control Metrics

- Quote Rate (Target: 70%+ on engaged calls)
- Application Rate (Target: 40%+ of quoted calls)
- Close Rate (Target: 10–15%)
- Talk Time per Hour (Target: 35–45+ minutes)
- Average Call Duration (Target: ~7 minutes)

These weren't passive numbers. They were early warning signals.

## Architectural Intent

- Catch breakdowns before they become habits
- Isolate exactly where conversion friction lives
- Protect cost-per-acquisition in inbound environments
- Tie behavior directly to revenue output
- Give managers a shared language for coaching

## 2. Daily Growth & Behavioral Correction Framework

Built a self-diagnostic system so agents could identify and fix their own breakdowns in real time — no manager required.

The framework introduced defined intervention triggers:

- 7+ short calls → opener / rapport issue
- Engaged calls without quoting → transition failure
- Multiple quotes without applications → value or trust breakdown

Each trigger required:

1. Immediate pause from live selling
2. Structured recording review
3. Guided self-assessment
4. Targeted rehearsal and tone correction
5. Re-entry only after correction

## System Design Principles

- Accountability without supervision dependency
- Correction speed as the real mastery metric
- One-call-close discipline in inbound environments
- Emotional connection over script rigidity
- Lead protection as an economic responsibility, not a suggestion

## Cross-Functional Impact

This didn't live in one department. Making it work required alignment across:

- Sales Leadership
- QA & Call Review
- Training & Enablement
- Revenue Operations
- Incentive & Compensation Design

The result was a distributed team that could self-regulate without falling out of sync with org-level revenue goals.

## Capabilities Demonstrated

- Revenue Performance Architecture
- Behavioral KPI Design
- Sales Conversion Mechanics
- Distributed Team Governance
- Coaching Systemization
- Lead Economics Protection

## 3. Structured Conversation & Conversion Framework

Designed a standardized inbound sales script built to take a prospect from introduction to application in one call — without feeling like a script.

The framework emphasized:

- Immediate rapport before anything else
- Fact-finding before quoting, every time
- Emotional positioning before price hits the table
- Clean objection isolation and recovery sequencing
- Controlled transition into application and payment

Reduced call drift, tightened quoting consistency, and made close rates more predictable across a high-autonomy remote team.
